/**
 * ============================================================================
 * WHY INBOXITEM EXISTS
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * InboxItem exists to create a unified, coherent attention surface that treats
 * Tasks and Events as equals in the user's attention queue.
 * 
 * PROBLEM IT SOLVES:
 * 
 * Without InboxItem, Inbox UI would need to:
 * - Maintain separate lists for Tasks and Events
 * - Branch on entity type throughout the UI
 * - Handle different data shapes and field names
 * - Create separate sorting/filtering logic
 * - Build separate UI components for each type
 * 
 * This creates fragmentation and cognitive load. Users see:
 * - "My Tasks" (separate list)
 * - "My Events" (separate list)
 * - Different UIs, different interactions, different mental models
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 * 
 * InboxItem unifies Tasks and Events into a single attention list where:
 * - All items share the same shape (common fields)
 * - All items answer the same questions (why, what, when)
 * - All items feel coherent in one list
 * - UI can treat them uniformly (sorting, filtering, display)
 * - Type differences are handled via discriminated union (type-safe branching)
 * 
 * RESULT:
 * 
 * Users see ONE unified Inbox that answers: "What do I need to act on now?"
 * They don't need to think about whether something is a Task or Event.
 * They just see attention-worthy work that needs action.
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * WHY TASK/EVENT COMPLEXITY IS HIDDEN
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Tasks and Events are complex domain models with many fields, relationships,
 * and business logic. InboxItem hides this complexity by:
 * 
 * 1. PROJECTION, NOT MODELS:
 *    - InboxItem is a projection of Task/Event models
 *    - Only attention-relevant fields are included
 *    - Domain complexity stays in domain models
 * 
 * 2. UNIFIED FIELD NAMES:
 *    - Tasks have 'dueDate', Events have 'dueAt' → InboxItem uses 'dueAt'
 *    - Tasks have 'status', Events have 'attentionType' → InboxItem uses 'attentionLabel'
 *    - Field name differences are normalized at projection time
 * 
 * 3. HUMAN-READABLE LABELS:
 *    - Instead of raw status codes, InboxItem provides 'attentionLabel'
 *    - Examples: "Due today", "Needs review", "Overdue", "Starts in 2 hours"
 *    - UI doesn't need to interpret status codes or attention types
 * 
 * 4. TYPE-SPECIFIC FIELDS ARE OPTIONAL:
 *    - Task-specific fields (completeAction) only exist when kind='task'
 *    - Event-specific fields (eventAttentionType) only exist when kind='event'
 *    - Common fields are always present
 * 
 * 5. COMPLETION MODEL IS UNIFIED:
 *    - Tasks: allowComplete=true, completeAction provided
 *    - Events: allowComplete=false (events don't "complete" in Inbox)
 *    - UI can check allowComplete without branching on kind
 * 
 * BENEFITS:
 * 
 * - Inbox UI code is simpler (no branching on entity type)
 * - Users see consistent experience (same fields, same interactions)
 * - Domain complexity doesn't leak into UI
 * - New item types can be added without changing Inbox UI
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * UX PHILOSOPHY OF A SINGLE ATTENTION LIST
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * Inbox is NOT a task manager or event calendar. It's an attention surface
 * that shows work requiring user action, regardless of whether that work
 * is a Task, Event, or future entity type.
 * 
 * CORE PRINCIPLES:
 * 
 * 1. ATTENTION-FIRST, NOT ENTITY-FIRST:
 *    - Users think: "What do I need to do?" not "What tasks do I have?"
 *    - Inbox shows attention moments, not entity lists
 *    - Tasks and Events are just different sources of attention
 * 
 * 2. TIME & URGENCY FIRST:
 *    - Items are sorted by urgency (overdue → due today → due soon)
 *    - Time relevance is the primary signal
 *    - Entity type is secondary (shown via sourceApp badge)
 * 
 * 3. COHERENT EXPERIENCE:
 *    - All items have the same visual treatment
 *    - All items answer the same questions (why, what, when)
 *    - All items use the same interaction patterns
 *    - Differences are subtle (icon, badge, completion action)
 * 
 * 4. SCANNABLE IN UNDER 3 SECONDS:
 *    - Each item shows: title, attentionLabel, dueAt, sourceApp
 *    - No dense information, no complex state machines
 *    - Human-readable labels, not system codes
 * 
 * 5. ACTION-ORIENTED:
 *    - Every item has a clear action (click to navigate, complete if allowed)
 *    - Completion is available for tasks, not events
 *    - Events require navigation to owning surface for action
 * 
 * WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS:
 * 
 * - They see ONE list of work, not multiple lists
 * - They don't need to switch contexts (Tasks vs Events)
 * - They can scan quickly and understand what needs action
 * - They can complete tasks directly or navigate to events
 * - The experience feels unified and coherent
 * 
 * WHAT THIS MEANS FOR DEVELOPERS:
 * 
 * - Inbox UI only needs to handle InboxItem, not Task/Event models
 * - Sorting/filtering logic is unified (works for all items)
 * - UI components are reusable (same component for all items)
 * - Type safety via discriminated union (kind field enables type-safe branching)
 * - New item types can be added without changing Inbox UI
