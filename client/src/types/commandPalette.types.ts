/**
 * ============================================================================
 * EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * The following are EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED from CommandPaletteItem because
 * they violate Command Palette invariants:
 * 
 * EXCLUDED FIELDS:
 * 
 * API PAYLOADS:
 * - requestBody: API request payloads (commands don't make API calls directly)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not API requests. API calls belong in
 *        action handlers, not command definitions. Commands navigate or
 *        trigger actions, they don't carry data.
 * 
 * - responseData: API response data (commands don't return data)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not data fetches. Commands navigate or
 *        trigger actions, they don't return entities or data.
 * 
 * - apiEndpoint: API endpoint URLs (commands don't make API calls)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions via navigation or component methods,
 *        not direct API calls. API integration belongs in action handlers.
 * 
 * ENTITY DATA:
 * - entityId: Entity identifiers (commands don't operate on entities)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not entity operations. Commands navigate
 *        to surfaces where entities are managed, they don't carry entity data.
 * 
 * - entityType: Entity types (commands don't operate on entities)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not entity operations. Entity operations
 *        belong in dedicated surfaces, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - entityData: Entity data objects (commands don't carry entity data)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not entity operations. Commands navigate
 *        or trigger actions, they don't carry entity payloads.
 * 
 * CONDITIONAL UI STATE:
 * - isEnabled: Conditional enablement (commands are always available)
 *   WHY: Commands are stateless and always available. Conditional behavior
 *        violates the "stateless" principle. If an action is conditional,
 *        it belongs in a context surface, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - isVisible: Conditional visibility (commands are always visible in context)
 *   WHY: Commands are filtered by context, not conditional visibility.
 *        Context filtering is handled by Command Palette component, not
 *        individual command definitions.
 * 
 * - requiresPermission: Permission checks (commands don't check permissions)
 *   WHY: Permission checks belong in action handlers or route guards, not
 *        command definitions. Commands are available based on context,
 *        permissions are enforced at execution time.
 * 
 * - dependsOnState: State dependencies (commands are stateless)
 *   WHY: Commands are stateless and don't depend on UI state. State-dependent
 *        actions belong in context surfaces, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - showWhen: Conditional display logic (commands are always shown in context)
 *   WHY: Commands are filtered by context, not conditional display logic.
 *        Context filtering is handled by Command Palette component.
 * 
 * FEATURE FLAGS:
 * - featureFlag: Feature flag references (commands don't depend on features)
 *   WHY: Commands are core actions, not feature-gated functionality. Feature
 *        flags belong in feature implementations, not command definitions.
 * 
 * CONFIGURATION:
 * - config: Command configuration (commands don't have configuration)
 *   WHY: Commands are stateless actions, not configurable features. Configuration
 *        belongs in Settings surface, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - options: Command options (commands don't have options)
 *   WHY: Commands execute single actions, not multi-option features. Options
 *        belong in dedicated surfaces, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - parameters: Command parameters (commands don't accept parameters)
 *   WHY: Commands execute fixed actions, not parameterized features. Parameters
 *        belong in dedicated surfaces or search mode, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * NESTED MENUS:
 * - subCommands: Sub-commands (commands don't have nested menus)
 *   WHY: Commands are flat, scannable actions. Nested menus violate the
 *        "no nested menus" principle. Complex actions belong in dedicated surfaces.
 * 
 * - children: Child commands (commands don't have children)
 *   WHY: Commands are flat, scannable actions. Nested structures violate
 *        the "no nested menus" principle.
 * 
 * HISTORY/STATE:
 * - lastUsed: Last usage timestamp (commands don't track history)
 *   WHY: Commands are stateless and don't track usage. History belongs in
 *        Search mode or dedicated surfaces, not Command Palette.
 * 
 * - usageCount: Usage count (commands don't track usage)
 *   WHY: Commands are stateless and don't track metrics. Metrics belong in
 *        analytics systems, not command definitions.
 * 
 * - recentItems: Recent items list (commands don't show history)
 *   WHY: Commands execute actions, not history browsing. History belongs in
 *        Search mode or dedicated surfaces.
 * 
 * These exclusions ensure that CommandPaletteItem remains a lightweight,
 * stateless command definition focused on fast action execution, not feature
 * complexity. Complex features belong in dedicated surfaces, not Command Palette.
