# ✅ Server Restarted Successfully!

## Status

✅ **Server Restarted**
- Port: 3000 (configured in `.env`)
- Health endpoint: ✅ Responding
- Rate limit bypass: ✅ Working (401 instead of 403)

## Rate Limit Bypass Verification

The rate limit bypass is **working correctly**! 

**Evidence:**
- Before: 403 Forbidden (rate limited)
- After: 401 Unauthorized (rate limit bypassed, but credentials issue)

The change from 403 to 401 confirms the bypass is functioning.

## Current Issue: Authentication Credentials

The test script is getting `401 Unauthorized` with message "Invalid credentials."

This means:
- ✅ Rate limiting is bypassed
- ✅ Server is responding
- ❌ Credentials need to be verified/updated

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Correct Credentials

If you know the correct password for `admin@arivu.com`, set it:

```bash
export TEST_EMAIL=admin@arivu.com
export TEST_PASSWORD=your-actual-password
node server/scripts/testFormsAPI.js
```

### Option 2: Reset Admin Password

To reset the admin password, you can:

1. **Delete and recreate admin:**
   ```bash
   # In MongoDB or MongoDB Compass
   db.users.deleteOne({email: "admin@arivu.com"})
   
   # Then recreate
   cd server
   node scripts/createDefaultAdmin.js
   ```

2. **Or update password directly in database** (if you have access)

### Option 3: Use Different User

If you have another user account:

```bash
export TEST_EMAIL=another-user@example.com
export TEST_PASSWORD=their-password
node server/scripts/testFormsAPI.js
```

## Test the Bypass Manually

You can verify the bypass is working with curl:

```bash
# This should work (bypass enabled)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Bypass-Rate-Limit: true" \
  -H "X-Test-Mode: true" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@arivu.com","password":"Admin@123"}'

# Should return 401 (invalid credentials) not 403 (rate limited)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify/update credentials** for `admin@arivu.com`
2. **Run test script again** once credentials are correct
3. **All tests should pass** once authentication succeeds

## Server Information

- **Port**: 3000 (from `.env`)
- **Health**: http://localhost:3000/health ✅
- **API Base**: http://localhost:3000/api
- **Mode**: DEVELOPMENT
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: ✅ ENABLED

## Summary

✅ Server restarted successfully  
✅ Rate limit bypass implemented and working  
✅ Middleware changes loaded  
⏳ Need correct credentials to proceed with tests

Once you have the correct credentials, the Forms Module API tests should run successfully!
